 * never touch the rows — and never noticed a change either (issue #90). An
 * update, an insert and a delete together leave the count where it was; any
 * same-length value change leaves both numbers identical. In the report three
 * data changes went unreported and the drift score stayed at 100.
 *
 * So the fingerprint is now a digest of the contents. It costs a sequential
 * scan per table per side, which is the right trade for this check: it compares
 * *reference* tables the user names in `checks.data.tables`, not the whole
