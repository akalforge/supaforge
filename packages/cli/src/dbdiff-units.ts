 * Some changes are several statements that only work together and in order —
 * an enum label swap, a column type change with the views reading it stood
 * aside, a generated column re-added, a serial column turned into an identity.
 * Split into separate findings they were reordered, half-applied, or held back

 * nothing here has to guess that from the SQL:
 *
 *   - a unit is one finding, whatever it holds;
 *   - its DOWN is the unit of the same kind and object in the DOWN section,
 *     not whatever happens to sit at the same position there.
