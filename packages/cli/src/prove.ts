/**
 * Convergence proof.
 *
 * A migration is only trustworthy if applying it actually produces the target
 * schema. Every silent-wrong-answer bug found so far shared one shape: the
 * generated SQL executed without error and left the database in a state that
 * was *not* the source — a duplicate primary key aborted loudly, but a
 * flattened partition, a dropped enum type name and an unpropagated index all
 * ran cleanly and lied.
 *
 * A text comparison cannot catch that class, and neither can a test suite that
 * only exercises the patterns its authors thought of. The only check that
 * generalises is to run the migration and look at what came out.
 *
 * So: copy the target's schema into a throwaway database, apply the migration
 * there, and diff the result against the source. Zero drift means the migration
 * does what it claims. Anything else is reported as residual drift, naming the
 * objects the migration failed to reproduce.
 *
 * The real target is never touched. The clone lives on the target's own server
 * (so no cross-host credentials are needed) and is dropped in a finally block
 * even when the proof throws.
