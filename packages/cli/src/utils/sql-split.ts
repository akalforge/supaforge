 * fragments, none of which parse, and whatever depends on the function fails
 * after them. That is what `restore` did to a pg_dump's functions and their
 * triggers (issue #80).
 *
 * The text is walked once, tracking the four things that can hold a semicolon
 * without ending a statement:
 *
 *   - `'single quoted'`, where `''` is an escaped quote and not a close
 *   - `"quoted identifiers"`, same doubling rule
 *   - `$tag$ dollar quoted $tag$`, which is how routine bodies arrive
 *   - line comments, and block comments, which nest in PostgreSQL
 *
 * Statements come back trimmed with the trailing `;` removed, and empty
 * fragments dropped. Comments are left in place: they are part of the
 * statement's text, and a caller wanting a bare statement can say so.
